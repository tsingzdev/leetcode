/*
 * A binary watch has 4 LEDs on the top which represent the hours (0-11), 
 * and the 6 LEDs on the bottom represent the minutes (0-59).

* Each LED represents a zero or one, with the least significant bit on the right.
* 
* 
* For example, the above binary watch reads "3:25".
* 
* Given a non-negative integer n which represents the number of LEDs that are 
* currently on, return all possible times the watch could represent.
* 
* Example:
* 
* Input: n = 1
* Return: ["1:00", "2:00", "4:00", "8:00", "0:01", "0:02", "0:04", "0:08", "0:16", "0:32"]
* Note:
* The order of output does not matter.
* The hour must not contain a leading zero, for example "01:00" is not valid, 
* it should be "1:00".
* The minute must be consist of two digits and may contain a leading zero, 
* for example "10:2" is not valid, it should be "10:02".

/**
 * Return an array of size *returnSize.
 * Note: The returned array must be malloced, assume caller calls free().
