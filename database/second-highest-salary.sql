Write a SQL query to get the second highest salary from the Employee table.

+----+--------+
| Id | Salary |
+----+--------+
| 1  | 100    |
| 2  | 200    |
| 3  | 300    |
+----+--------+
For example, given the above Employee table, the second highest salary is 200. If there is no second highest salary, then the query should return null.

DROP TABLE IF EXISTS Employee;
CREATE TABLE Employee (
Id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
Salary INT NOT NULL, 
PRIMARY KEY (Id) 
 );
 
INSERT INTO Employee(Salary) VALUES (100),(200),(300);
 
SELECT * FROM Employee;

 
SELECT MAX(Salary) FROM Employee
WHERE Salary < ( SELECT MAX(Salary) FROM Employee);
 

 
SELECT (SELECT MAX(Salary) FROM Employee WHERE Salary NOT IN 
(SELECT MAX(Salary) FROM Employee)) AS SecondhighestSalary;
